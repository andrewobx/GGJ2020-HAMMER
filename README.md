# 2020 Global Game Jam Honolulu: Arm Simulator

For the [2020 Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/arm-simulator-3) this game was inspired by the famous ragdoll game [QWOP](http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html) where you control an arm instead of legs. Use the keys "A" and "S" for the wrist, "G" and "H" for the forearm, and "K" and "L" for the bicep/shoulder. To make it more interesting, bring in your friends to control one limb each! So... can you "nail" it?
