Thank you for purchasing Handy Poses by minus7media!

These Mechanim-ready animation clips can be found inside of minus7media > Handy Poses > Animations. Expand the Handy Poses.fbx item dropdown to find all of the animation clips.

Depending on how your Mechanim avatar is setup, you may notice that animations applied to them may not necessarily map out exactly like the original animation and avatar i.e.) pinch animation may not have index finger and thumb touching. The follow video demonstration walks through the process of changing your avatar's configuration to improve the playback results using animations created from a different model + avatar:

Additionally, depending on your ability to animate, the provided rig with the animations can also be modified to better match your model's needs.

Enjoy!
